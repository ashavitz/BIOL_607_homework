              Ecological theory predicts that kelp forests structured by trophic cascades should experience recovery and persistence of their foundation species when herbivores become rare. Yet, climate change may be altering the outcomes of top‐down forcing in kelp forests, especially those located in regions that have rapidly warmed in recent decades, such as the Gulf of Maine. Here, using data collected annually from 30+ sites spanning {\textgreater}350 km of coastline, we explored the dynamics of Maine's kelp forests in the {\textasciitilde}20 years after a fishery‐induced elimination of sea urchin herbivores. Although forests (
              Saccharina latissima
              and
              Laminaria digitata
              ) had broadly returned to Maine in the late 20th century, we found that forests in northeast Maine have since experienced slow but significant declines in kelp, and forest persistence in the northeast was juxtaposed by a rapid, widespread collapse in the southwest. Forests collapsed in the southwest apparently because ocean warming has—directly and indirectly—made this area inhospitable to kelp. Indeed, when modeling drivers of change using causal techniques from econometrics, we discovered that unusually high summer seawater temperatures the year prior, unusually high spring seawater temperatures, and high sea urchin densities each negatively impacted kelp abundance. Furthermore, the relative power and absolute impact of these drivers varied geographically. Our findings reveal that ocean warming is redefining the outcomes of top‐down forcing in this system, whereby herbivore removal no longer predictably leads to a sustained dominance of foundational kelps but instead has led to a waning dominance (northeast) or the rise of a novel phase state defined by “turf” algae (southwest). Such findings indicate that limiting climate change and managing for low herbivore abundances will be essential for preventing further loss of the vast forests that still exist in northeast Maine. They also more broadly highlight that climate change is “rewriting the rules” of nature, and thus that ecological theory and practice must be revised to account for shifting species and processes.},

            Ecologists seek to understand the intermediary ecological processes through which changes in one attribute in a system affect other attributes. A causal understanding of mediating processes is important for testing theory and developing resource management and conservation strategies. Yet, quantifying the causal effects of these mediating processes in ecological systems is challenging, because it requires defining what we mean by a “mediated effect”, determining what assumptions are required to estimate mediation effects without bias, and assessing whether these assumptions are credible in a study. To address these challenges, scholars have made significant advances in research designs for mediation analysis. Here, we review these advances for ecologists. To illustrate both the advances and the challenges in quantifying mediation effects, we use a hypothetical ecological study of drought impacts on grassland productivity. With this study, we show how common research designs used in ecology to detect and quantify mediation effects may have biases and how these biases can be addressed through alternative designs. Throughout the review, we highlight how causal claims rely on causal assumptions, and we illustrate how different designs or definitions of mediation effects can relax some of these assumptions. In contrast to statistical assumptions, causal assumptions are not verifiable from data, and so we also describe procedures that we can use to assess the sensitivity of a study's results to potential violations of its causal assumptions. The advances in causal mediation analyses reviewed herein equip ecologists to communicate clearly the causal assumptions necessary for valid inferences, and to examine and address potential violations to these assumptions using suitable experimental and observational designs, which will enable rigorous and reproducible explanations of intermediary processes in ecology.},

                  Randomized experiments have long been the gold standard in determining causal effects in ecological control–impact studies. However, it may be difficult to address many ecologically and policy‐relevant control–impact questions‐such as the effect of forest fragmentation or protected areas on biodiversity through experimental manipulation due to scale, costs and ethical considerations. Yet, ecologists may still draw causal insights in observational control–impact settings by exploiting research designs that approximate the experimental ideal.
                
                
                  Here, we review the challenges of making causal inference in non‐experimental control–impact scenarios as well as a suite of statistical tools specifically designed to overcome such challenges. These tools are widely used in fields where experimental research is more limited (i.e., medicine, economics), and could be applied by ecologists across numerous sub‐disciplines.
                
                
                  Using hypothetical examples, we discuss why bias is likely to plague observational control–impact studies in ways that do not surface with experimental manipulations, why bias is generally the barrier to causal inference, and different methods to overcome this bias.
                
                
                  Satellite‐, survey‐ and citizen–science data hold great potential for advancing key questions in ecology that would otherwise be prohibitive to pursue experimentally. However, to harness such data to understand causal impacts of land, environmental and policy changes, we must expand our toolset such that we can improve inference and more confidently advance ecological understanding and science‐informed policy.},

This study aims to better understand regional long‐term climate trends caused by the Gulf Stream decadal variability. The in situ data analysis confirms a continuous slow warming within all three areas over the last five decades. It is shown that the warming accelerated in the recent 10 years coinciding with a strengthened northward incursion of warm water in the summer months. Such strong northward migration of warm water was not seen in the four preceding decades, making the current rapid warming different from previous ones. We argue that the recent decadal‐scale warming is unique and may signal that the shift of the thermal regime in this region may be at least partially caused by a changed pattern of the Gulf Stream extension zone's long‐term variability. We found that the Scotian Shelf and Slope Water region has recently been warming much faster than the Gulf of Maine, both in the subsurface (the upper {\textasciitilde} 50 m) and in deeper layers, indicating that the probable cause of the faster warming in the most recent decade is due to the regime change in the Gulf Stream extension region.},

	abstract = {Water temperature is an important environmental factor for many ecological processes in coastal ecosystems. Here, we study water temperature dynamics at a set of study sites on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia where eelgrass beds are found. The central emphasis is to predict temperature on scales relevant to coastal ecosystem processes using a high-resolution nearshore oceanographic model based on the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). The model predictions were evaluated against observed temperature time series at six sites for three years from 2017-2019; the evaluation indicates that the model was able to replicate the temperature variation on time scales from hours to seasonal. We also used various biologically tailored temperature metrics relevant to eelgrass condition, including mean seasonal values and variability, daily ranges, growing degree day (GDD), and warm events, to validate the model against time series observations to better understand the temperature regime at the study sites. Frequency resolved Willmott skill scores were \&gt;0.7, and the temperature metrics were well predicted with the exception of a bias in GDD at some of the shallow sites. The eelgrass sites have a wide range of temperature conditions. Mean water temperature in the summer differed by more than 7°C between the shallowest and the deepest sites, and the rate of heat accumulation was fastest at shallow sites which had ≥ 12 extreme warm events per year. While the amplitude of the temperature variations within the high frequency band (\&lt;48 hr) was greater in shallower sites, temperature changes on meteorological time scales (48 hr to 60 days) were coherent at all sites, suggesting the importance of coast-wide processes. The results of this study demonstrated that our high resolution numerical model captured biologically relevant temperature dynamics at different time scales and over a large spatial region, and yet still accurately predicted detailed temperature dynamics at specific nearshore sites. Thus, the model can provide important insights into coastal temperature dynamics that are potentially useful for conservation planning and understanding the implications of future change.},
